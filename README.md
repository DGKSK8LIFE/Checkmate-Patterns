# Checkmate Pattern Finder

## Premise

  Given the ending FEN of a chess game, the program will be able to classify the check mate pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate_pattern) 
I am also planning to use the Lichess API so it can give you a rundown of the different types of checkmates you've given in lichess.org.
